# Checkout Calculator App

This Checkout Calculator App allows you to add or remove products from our online "gift shop" and immediately see a summary of the cost of these products in your checkout cart.

## Instructions

Simply visit <https://your-favorite-gift-shop.herokuapp.com/> and add or remove items we offer as you please. We will automatically calculate the subtotal, tax (Ontario's 13% tax), and Total for you.

As a special bonus ðŸ¤« we have added a discount code **SAVE20**, which you can enter in the discount code text field right below the Total sum, click *Apply* and enjoy an awesome 20% off!

Although you cannot pay for the thing in your cart, nor can we deliver the goods to you, we hope you enjoyed your stay at our little online gift shop.
